This folder contains files for fitting a piecewise exponential model with no cut points. 

The folder contains the following files:
  1. FE_model.txt - this file contains the WinBUGS model code
  2. piecewise_FE_model.R - this file fits the piecewise model in WinBUGS
  3. survival_plot.R - this file creates a plot of the survival curves resulting from the model fitted in piecewise_FE_model.R
  4. rank_plot.R - this file creates a plot of the probability of each treatment obtaining each rank resulting from the model fitted in piecewise_FE_model.R
