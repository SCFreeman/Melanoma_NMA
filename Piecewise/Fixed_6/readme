This folder contains files for fitting a piecewise exponential model with one cut point at 6 months. 

The folder contains the following files:
1. FE_model.txt - this file contains the WinBUGS model code  
2. piecewise_FE_model.R - this file fits the piecewise model in WinBUGS  
3. survival_plot.R - this file creates a plot of the survival curves resulting from the model fitted in piecewise_FE_model.R and calculates the area under each survival curve at 60 months 
4. rank_plot.R - this file creates a plot of the probability of each treatment obtaining each rank resulting from the model fitted in piecewise_FE_model.R
