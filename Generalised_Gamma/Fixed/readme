This folder contains files for fitting a generalised gamma model with treatment modelled as a location parameter

The folder contains the following files:
1. FE_model.txt - this file contains the WinBUGS model code  
2. Gen_Gamma_FE.R - this file fits the piecewise model in WinBUGS and plots the resulting survival curves for each treatment and calculates the area under each survival curve at 60 months
3. rank_plot.R - this file creates a plot of the probability of each treatment obtaining each rank resulting from the model fitted in Gen_Gamma_FE.R
