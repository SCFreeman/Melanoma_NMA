This folder contains files for fitting the Royston-Parmar model including treatment-ln(time) interactions to account for non-proportional hazards

The folder contains the following files:
1. model.txt - this file contains the WinBUGS model code  
2. RP.R - this file runs the model in WinBUGS. Note: due to the large number of iterations required for the Royston-Parmar model to run and the large number of parameters to save memory problems were encountered when running the model in WinBUGS from R. Therefore, the model was run directly in WinBUGS using the data and initial value files created in R. The results were saved as a .odc file in WinBUGS itself and copied into a .csv file so that they could be easily loaded into R. 
3. results.odc - a WinBUGS file containing the results
4. results.csv - a csv file containing the results from results.odc
5. survival_plot.R - this file creates a plot of the survival curves resulting from the model fitted in RP.R and calculates the area under each survival curve at 60 months 
6. rank_plot.R - this file creates a plot of the probability of each treatment obtaining each rank resulting from the model fitted in RP.R
